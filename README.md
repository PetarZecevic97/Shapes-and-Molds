# Shapes-and-Molds
An old faculty project where you score by moving objects through molds that fit. 
A random object is generated that needs to be moved and rotated. When it fits the mold, a new random object appears and so on.

Instructions:
g - start the game
r - restart the game
q, e - move the camera left and right
w, s - move the camera up and down
u, o - rotate the object
i, k - move the object on x axis
j, l - move the object on y axis
y, h - move the object on z axis
